Situation
Reddit is a popular online platform with thousands of communities (subreddits) where users post content and engage in discussions. Manually participating in multiple subreddits to comment and interact can be time-consuming and inconsistent.

Task
The goal was to create an automated, responsible Reddit bot that can:

Log in to Reddit using secure credentials,
Select posts from specified subreddits based on configurable criteria,
Post comments using templates or a file,
Avoid spamming or violating Redditâ€™s rules,
Log its activity and handle errors gracefully.

Action
Configuration: Used a .env file and a config module to securely manage credentials and bot settings.
Reddit API: Utilized the PRAW library to interact with Reddit.
Automation: Implemented logic to select suitable posts, avoid duplicate or inappropriate comments, and respect rate limits.
Logging: Added detailed logging (with Unicode support) to track actions and errors.
Extensibility: Allowed for dry-run mode, interactive mode, and easy adjustment of behavior via config files.

Result
The bot can automatically comment on Reddit posts across multiple subreddits, following best practices and user-defined rules.
It reduces manual effort, increases engagement, and provides clear logs for monitoring.
The project is modular, secure, and easy to extend or adapt for new requirements.
